This is the most simple project to boot a simple ARM-based board, the VersatilePB board.

Different documents are available online, mostly from ARM website. You will need
several technical reference manuals, like it is the case with most embedded systems.
Unfortunately, these manuals are written from both hardware and software perspective,
making them hard to read for software developers. Yet, they are full of information.
				
--------------------------------------------------------------------
SETUP
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You must have a toolchain for ARM... because you will be cross-compiling and cross-debugging
from your laptop/desktop (assuming you have an Intel/AMD hardware, either 32 or 64 bits).

The toolchain gcc-arm-none-eabi has been used successfully. You can install it via your 
normal software installer from your distribution

	$ sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi

Nota Bene: 
           You must use all the tools from your toolchain, consistently.
		   At the very least, this means the following:
		    
             - you must compile using the gcc compiler for the ARM processor
             - you must link using the gcc linker for the ARM processor
             - you must debug using the gdb debugger for the ARM processor

           You most likely mistake will be to start a gdb for your own platform,
           not the ARM platform emulated by Qemu.
                      

--------------------------------------------------------------------
NAVIGATING THE CODE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The execution starts in startup.o, which contains the minimum setup in assembly language.
The assembly entry point is the label _entry. 

Then the execution goes up in C, with the c_entry(void) function as the C entry point.
The C code is a simple program that polls UART0 and echoes every character received
on UART0.

This code does not setup interrupts... so this is active polling... so expect to hear
your fan ramp up pretty rapidly. ;-) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Makefile
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The makefile is a real vanilla makefile, nothing fancy or difficult.

It is structured for cross-compilation, so you must give the path to your toolchain for ARM processor.

The makefile can be used for everything:
	- compiling and linking.
	- launching the emulation on Qemu.
	- debugging on Qemu.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Launching an emulation on Qemu
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The simplest is to use the given makefile:

	$ make run
	
This will launch Qemu, emulating a VersatilePB board, loading your code (test.bin).
Look at the makefile to see how test.bin is created using the objcopy tool from 
the test.elf executable. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging an emulation on Qemu

	COMMAND LINE DEBUGGING
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You can easily debug also, using Qemu. You will need two terminals though,
one to start Qemu first and the other to start the GNU gdb debugger.
In the first terminal:

	$ make debug
	
And in the second terminal, you will need to start GDB.

	$ gcc-arm-none-eabi-gdb
	(gdb) 

Now, go read the README-GDB !
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Debugging an emulation on Qemu

	ECLIPSE DEBUGGING
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You can also debug from Eclipse. You will need to start Qemu manually,
and you will need to launch the debugger from Eclipse, configuring it
to do remote debugging through TCP on localhost:1234

--------------------------------------------------------------------
To Go Deeper -- More Information
--------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need the technical reference manual of the processor of your board:

	- DDI0222	ARM9EJ-S
				Revision: r1p2
				Technical Reference Manual

You will need the technical reference manual of your board, describing many features
of the board design.
				
	- DUI0225D	Versatile Application Baseboard for ARM926EJ-S (HBI-0118)
				
	- DUI0224I 	RealView Platform Baseboard for ARM926EJ-S (HBI-0117)

You will also need the technical reference manual of the different devices, available
on your board. In this simple example, we only use the UART:
	
	- DDI0183  	PrimeCell UART (PL011) 
			 	Revision: r1p4
