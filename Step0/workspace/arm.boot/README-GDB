=======================================================================
GNU GDB usage
=======================================================================

GDB is a powerful debugger for the C/C++ languages.
There are plenty of tutorials on the Web, so this will
be about the commands I personally use all the times.
Many other ways of using gdb exists.

Tip: you can use GDB as a command line tool, or you can use GDB from a front-end tool. 

     Eclipse is one choice, with the C/C++ environment, that is, the CDT plugin.
     It works nicely but Eclipse does not support the GDB console, so there is so much
     you cannot do that it is really ANNOYING. But as a quick start, to single step
     and debug your code, it works nicely.

     Emacs can be used, although if you are not already an Emacs user, 
     it may be a bit confusing at first. You have the ability to exploit the power of
     Emacs with a full support of GDB features. Neat.

     You may use DDD, a nice X11 front-end, but usually DDD launches with ugly fonts,
     so it needs a little bit of configuring, but after that, it works great.
     See the DDD section at the end of this README. 
     DDD is also a nice combo, supporting the GDB console, for a complete access
     to the full debugging power of GDB. 

Tip: remember that for easy debugging, your program must
     have been compiled with debug symbols (at least -g with GNU gcc).
     also, remember that optimized code might be difficult to debug
     as the compiler moved your code around when optimizing.

Tip: to know more about any command, simply ask for help:

  (gdb) help layout
  Change the layout of windows.
  Usage: layout prev | next | <layout_name> 
  Layout names are:
   src   : Displays source and command windows.
   asm   : Displays disassembly and command windows.
   split : Displays source, disassembly and command windows.
   regs  : Displays register window. If existing layout
           is source/command or assembly/command, the 
           register window is displayed. If the
           source/assembly/command (split) is displayed, 
           the register window is displayed with 
           the window that has current logical focus.

=======================================================================
GDB interface
=======================================================================

GDB is really a command line tool, powerful but sometimes cumbersome.
One of its weaknesses is about showing the source, that is, where
the execution is at.

  (gdb) list

You can list also any specific range of lines:

  (gdb) l 120,133   

That is a possibility, although not super user-friendly. 
Look at more ways to list the source with:

  (gdb) help list

One of these ways is to use different layouts.
Before you do so, make sure you resize your terminal window is be tall 
and not too wide, typically like a half screen. Then start gdb and choose
the source layout:

  (gdb) layout source

You will then have your terminal window split in two parts.
The top will show you the source, when stopped at a breakpoint,
the bottom half will be your regular gdb window.

You can cycle through the different layout with the layout command:

    (gdb) layout next

=======================================================================
Launching and stopping
=======================================================================

To launch GDB, there are several ways.
The most obvious way is to have gdb start your program from a shell:

   $ gdb your-program
   (gdb) run <with you arguments here>

Ctrl-C stops the execution.
To know where you are:

   (gdb) where

The output gives you the current call stack, on the current thread.
To know which thread you are on:

   (gdb) thread
   [Current thread is 1 (Thread 1)]
   (gdb) info threads
     Id   Target Id         Frame 
   * 1    Thread 1 (CPU#0 [running]) diskboot (_eax=1785688930, _ebx=129984) at loader.c:122

You can kill your program at any time and then restart it.
You can even "make" it without leaving gdb.

    (gdb) kill
    Kill the program being debugged? (y or n) y
    (gdb) make
    (gdb) run

Tip: if you kill your program, edit it, re-make it outside of gdb,
     gdb is smart enough to know and reload your program before running it.

=======================================================================
Breakpoints
=======================================================================

But even better, you can set breakpoints:

   (gdb) br *0x7c00          // giving a memory address
   (gdb) br boot.S:136       // a assembly-source file and a line number
   (gdb) br loader.c:122     // a C-source file and a line number
   (gdb) br diskboot         // a function name

To know what breakpoints you already have:
   (gdb) info br
   Num     Type           Disp Enb Address    What
   1       breakpoint     keep y   0x00007c00 boot.S:53
     	   breakpoint already hit 1 time
   2       breakpoint     keep y   0x00007c56 boot.S:136
	   breakpoint already hit 1 time
   3       breakpoint     keep y   0x00007db5 in diskboot at loader.c:122
   	   breakpoint already hit 1 time

To remove a breakpoint, use the delete command, with a breakpoint number:

   (gdb) d 1

=======================================================================
Watches
=======================================================================

You can also use watches... which is just incredibly powerful.

   (gdb) help watch
   Set a watchpoint for an expression.
   Usage: watch [-l|-location] EXPRESSION
   A watchpoint stops execution of your program whenever the value of
   an expression changes.
   If -l or -location is given, this evaluates EXPRESSION and watches
   the memory to which it refers.
   (gdb) 

For example, you can use it to stop whenever a memory location is changed.
Assuming you have a variable i, let's say a global variable.
    
   (gdb) p /x &i
   $1 = 0x1001a0
   (gdb) watch -l *0x1001a0
   Hardware watchpoint 6: -location *0x1001a0
   (gdb)

=======================================================================
Execution
=======================================================================

Now commands related to executing your program, when you are stopped
at a breakpoint or following a Crtl-C.

   (gdb) continue
   (gdb) step
   (gdb) next
   (gdb) finish

Tip: you can use them as single character commands: c,s,n,f

Tip: note that once you have typed a command, hitting return will repeat it.

Note:
      You have stepi and nexti to single step through assembly instructions.
      The next/step commands are for single-stepping C programs.

As you can see, gdb works line by line, using regular commands.

=======================================================================
Printing / Displaying
=======================================================================

To print a variable:

   (gdb) print your_variable
   (gdb) p /x your_variable

You can display also, in which case, gdb will print the variable 
whenever it stops.

   (gdb) display /x your_variable

You can also examine memory directly with the following command: 

   x/FMT ADDRESS.

   ADDRESS is an expression for the memory address to examine.

   FMT is a repeat count followed by a format letter and a size letter.
   Format letters are the following:
       o(octal), x(hex), d(decimal), u(unsigned decimal),
       t(binary), f(float), a(address), i(instruction), c(char), s(string)
       z(hex, zero padded on the left).
   Size letters are the following:
       b(byte), h(halfword), w(word), g(giant, 8 bytes).

The specified number of objects of the specified size are printed
according to the format.

Examples:

	(gdb) x/4xb 0x1000    // To print 4 bytes in hexadecimal at 0x1000
	(gdb) x/4xw 0x1000    // To print 4 words (32bits) in hexadecimal at 0x1000
	(gdb) x/2uw 0x1000    // To print 2 words (32bits) as unsigned decimal at 0x1000


Note:
      Defaults for format and size letters are those previously used.
      Default count is 1.  Default address is following last thing printed
      with this command or "print".

=======================================================================
Remote debugging
=======================================================================

This is especially useful in the embedded world, either when debugging
with JTAG hardware debuggers or with Qemu.

Qemu embeds a GDB stub so that gdb can attach to qemu... right up to
the very instruction executed by your program. Just fantastic.

    $> qemu-system-i386  <you options> -s -S

In another terminal window:

    $> gdb boot.elf
    (gdb) br *0x7c00
    (gdb) target remote:1234
    0x0000fff0 in ?? ()
    (gdb) cont
    Continuing.
    Breakpoint 1, start () at boot.S:53
    53			cli				# Disable interrupts
    (gdb) 

=======================================================================
Loading symbols
=======================================================================

To work, gdb needs to know the symbols of your program. 
Gdb reads the symbols from your program file, not from the executing process.

    $> gdb toto
    Reading symbols from toto...done.

Sometimes, it is necessary to load symbols. 
It is the case in our step1, to switch from the boot.elf symbols
to the kernel.elf symbols when the loader is done loading the kernel.elf
and jumping to the entry point in the kernel.

    (gdb) symbol kernel.elf
    Load new symbol table from "kernel.elf"? (y or n) y
    Reading symbols from kernel.elf...done.
    (gdb) 

=======================================================================
Attaching to a running process
=======================================================================

You can also attach to a currently running program.
See the attach command.

  (gdb) help attach

=======================================================================
GDB and Eclipse
=======================================================================

Eclipse is great for navigating sources. It also provides a nice integrated
experience for debugging. However, one of its weaknesses is the graphical
interface only. With gdb, one really needs to have the gdb console available.
Still, it is an interesting setup that will help you be more effective.

Follow these steps to setup your Eclipse.

You must have the CDT plugin installed in Eclipse for C/C++ support.

Import your project, as a C/C++ projet, with existing makefile.
When importing, it is **crucial** to choose the correct toolchain,
on linux it is the Linux GCC toolchain, corresponding to the fact
that we are compiling and debugging with GNU tools (gcc and gdb).

You should have a project, and you should be able to view and navigate
the sources.

I would suggest to make clean and make outside of Eclipse, but you can 
do it from Eclipse. Just make sure you make the target all, not any other
target.

Setting up debugging is the trickier part. You have to setup a debug
configuration manually.

1- build and select (color with one click) the kernel.elf, in the package
   browser view (it is the "executable" we will want Eclipse to debug).
2- Open the debug configurations
3- Select the template for remote debugging C/C++ applications
   and create one configuration
4- Edit that configuration
    4.1 select the main tab
	- Keep stop in main, but replace by kmain (we do not have a main function).
	- the C/C++ application should be either kernel.elf or ia32/kernel.elf,
          depending if you imported your project as the bootloader/ia32 directory
	  or the bootloader directory.
        
    4.2 Selecting the debugger tab
	- Remove .gdbinit (it will interfere will the Eclipse control of gdb).
	- Select the tab connection:
		set type to TCP
		set the hostname to localhost
		set the port to 1234.
	If you see something about a gdbserver there, on the debugging tab,
	as opposed to something about TCP and a port,
	most probably, you selected the wrong toolchain.
 
Once you have the configuration setup, you can start qemu in debug mode (-s -S),
either manually or with the make dbg. Qemu will start and pause waiting for a 
connection on the port 1234, before executing any instruction of your program.

Launch debug with your new configuration and Eclipse will connect to Qemu 
and will show you the first instruction. To launch debugging the first time,
go back to the debug configuration and click debug. After that, a quick launch
is possible with the debug icon and its drop-down menu of the recent debug configurations
that were used.

=======================================================================
GDB and DDD
=======================================================================

DDD is a graphical front end to GDB. It provides the GUI basic stuff
you expect and it supports the GDB console, delivering the full debugging
power of GDB to your finger tips.

Install DDD through your distro, this should not be a problem.
The manual is pretty self explanatory, so you should have no problem there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
WARNING: the following hacking may no longer be needed or working...
         on Ubuntu 16.04, DDD is working just fine.
	 So I would not mess with the following, unless you really want to.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, sometimes, on some distro (like Ubuntu 14.04), DDD does not find 
its fonts and defaults to ugly looking fonts, making using DDD really difficult.

Here is the fix I used.

1) Once you installed DDD, and launched it once, you should have ~/.ddd directory.
   In that directory, you have the launch configuration in the "init" file.
   Edit that file and search for the following section:

	! Fonts.
	Ddd*defaultFont: -bitstream-courier 10 pitch
	Ddd*variableWidthFont: -bitstream-courier 10 pitch
	Ddd*fixedWidthFont: -bitstream-courier 10 pitch
	Ddd*dataFont: -bitstream-courier 10 pitch
	Ddd*FontSize: 120

   You can see that I use the Courier 10 pitch font, bitstream.
   You may have this one or not.
   To know which fonts you have, you can try this command:

	$ fc-list | cut -f2 -d: | sort -u
	 Abyssinica SIL
	 Accanthis ADF Std
	 Accanthis ADF Std No2
	 Accanthis ADF Std No3
	 Asana Math
	 Bitstream Charter
	 Cabin
	 Century Schoolbook L
	 Comfortaa
	 Courier
	 Courier 10 Pitch
	 DejaVu Sans
	 ...

   You might prefer a paged output with:

	$ fc-list | cut -f2 -d: | sort -u | less -r

Another way is to use the xfontsel program from X11

	$ xfontsel

You will get a window that allows you to select available fonts,
seeing which ones are installed and available.
To do this, do the following:

	- click first on -fndry and select from the drop-down menu 
	  the option "bitstream". 
	- click then on -fmly and select fromt the drop-down menu 
	  the option "Courier 10 Pitch" or some other family.
	- and so on if you need to be more specific about the fonts
	  you wish to use
